  Warnings:

  - The values [TAKEWAY] on the enum `ConsumptionMethod` will be removed. If these variants are still used in the database, this will fail.
  - You are about to drop the column `avatarImgUrl` on the `Restaurant` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Added the required column `avatarImageUrl` to the `Restaurant` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
